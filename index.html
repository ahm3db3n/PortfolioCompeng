								Hi, I’m Ahmed. This portfolio highlights a range of projects where I applied hands-on skills using software tools, machinery, and problem-solving techniques. Across each project, I followed structured steps such as planning, execution, testing, and reflection. I enjoyed working on these projects because they allowed me to combine creativity with technical thinking. Through this work, I learned how to manage time effectively, adapt when problems arise, and improve my attention to detail. If I were to start again, I would spend more time planning each stage in advance to make the workflow even more efficient.

								<p>
								In this project, I used a combination of hands-on tools, digital software, and machinery depending on the task. For example, car detailing required professional cleaning tools and equipment, while technical projects involved working with circuitry and presentation software. The process started with research and preparation, followed by hands-on execution, testing, and final presentation. I really enjoyed this project because it allowed me to apply real-world skills and take ownership of my work. I learned how to troubleshoot issues, improve efficiency, and balance precision with speed. If I could restart this project, I would document each step more thoroughly so I could track improvements and refine my process even further.

								<p>
								My recent work focused heavily on developing programming skills using the Turing software environment. I followed a step-by-step process that included understanding the problem, writing code, testing it, and debugging errors. I enjoyed this project because it challenged me to think logically and creatively at the same time. Through this experience, I learned the fundamentals of programming, problem-solving, and computational thinking. If I were to redo this project, I would start experimenting with more advanced features earlier to push my learning further.

								<p>
								Creating my resume involved using digital documentation tools to organize my skills, experience, and projects clearly and professionally. The process included drafting content, revising wording, and formatting the document for clarity. I enjoyed building my resume because it helped me reflect on what I’ve accomplished and identify areas for growth. I learned how to present information effectively and professionally. If I could improve it further, I would customize different versions of my resume for specific industries or career paths.
